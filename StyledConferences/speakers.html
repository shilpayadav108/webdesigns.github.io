      <h2>Aaron Irizarry</h2>
      <h5>Designing a Culture of Design</h5>

      <p>Workplace culture doesn&#8217;t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn&#8217;t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It&#8217;s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it&#8217;s what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.</p>

      <p>In Aaron&#8217;s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that others don&#8217;t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace&#8217;s culture. Once you&#8217;ve worked within a culture of design it&#8217;s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</p>

      <h5>About Aaron</h5>

      <h5>Lights! Camera! Interaction! Design Inspiration from Filmmakers</h5>

      <p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It&#8217;s the filmmaker&#8217;s job to put this together. To do so they&#8217;ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told story.</p>

      <p>With this workshop, we&#8217;ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We&#8217;ll look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We&#8217;ll consider why they&#8217;re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.</p>

      <h5>About Adam</h5>

      <p>Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration, communication, creativity and storytelling. As an Experience Design Director with Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ years of experience in interaction and experience design with a background in computer science, film, and animation to create effective and easy-to-use digital products and services. He believes that no matter how utilitarian a tool is, at the core of its creation lies a story; uncovering that story is key to its success. Occasionally, he shares his perspectives on design at <a href="http://adamconnor.com/">adamconnor.com</a> and <a href="http://www.discussingdesign.com/">discussingdesign.com</a>.</p>

      <h5>Death to Wireframes: Long Live Rapid Prototyping</h5>

      <p>Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes things a little better by allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is even better and faster; it increases collaboration and improves the iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.</p>

      <h5>About Bermon</h5>

      <p>Bermon is the organizer of various community groups for user experience designers and front-end developers, and the organizer of Blend Conference, a three-day, multi-track event for user experience strategists, designers and developers.
